# spring-boot-todo-app
We are building a Todo manager. In our application, users can create, update,
view and delete various Todo items.

The service should provide a RESTful API that allows to:
1. add an item,
2. change description of an item, mark an item as "done", mark an item as "not done",
3. get all items that are "not done" (with an option to retrieve all items),
4. get details of a specific item from list

   [Note: Restful backend and frontend API not saperated currently]

**To build our Todo application, we will use the following technologies/tools**:-
1. Spring Boot
2. H2 In-memory database
3. Spring Data JPA
4. BootStrap
5. Thymeleaf
6. Spring Tool Suite (STS)
